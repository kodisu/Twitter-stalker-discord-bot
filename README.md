# Twitter-stalker-discord-bot
A scrapy weekend project - this bot will scrap the Twitter v2 API to "stalk" accounts and update a Discord bot if the "stalked" account has followed any new accounts

The Twitter Stalker Bot was a great learning oppurtunity you learn about Webhooks, API calls with POSTMAN, parsing JSON, as well as threading. 

The project was inspired by freeCodeCamps.org [Code a Discord Bot with Python - Host for Free in the Cloud
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) <br /> 
Which used https://replit.com and https://uptimerobot.com to run a "free" bot in the cloud.
